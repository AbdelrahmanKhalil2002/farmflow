Web frontend multi-farm UI (switcher, per-farm analytics, per-farm listing creation) is the remaining piece.

- 30.4 — Live auctions
- 30.6 — AI price recommendations
- 30.8 — Public API/webhooks
- 36.1–36.11 — Email features require SMTP credentials (SMTP_HOST/USER/PASS in `/var/www/farmflow/backend/.env` on Droplet); all features degrade gracefully without them

**Remaining Flutter items:**
- M23.8–M23.9 — Google Play + App Store store listings (needs developer accounts + screenshots)
